dc

dc aims to be a multithread D2 compiler written in D2.

First goal is to write a Lexer for D2, which creates class instances for all 
Token. Next thing to do, is to send the token to a parser threads which checks
whether the list of token form valid statements. No more steps are planed yet.

Every of the six compiler steps will be divided in corresponding directories 
and files.
